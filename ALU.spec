1. Arithmetic Operations:
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides one number by another.
2. Logic Operations:
AND: Logical AND operation.
OR: Logical OR operation.
NOT: Logical NOT operation.
XOR: Logical XOR operation.
NAND: Logical NAND operation.
NOR: Logical NOR operation.
3. Shift Operations:
Shift Left (Logical): Shifts all bits in a binary number to the left.
Shift Right (Logical): Shifts all bits in a binary number to the right.
Shift Right (Arithmetic): Shifts all bits in a binary number to the right, preserving the sign bit.
Rotate Left/Right: Rotates all bits in a binary number to the left or right.
4. Comparison Operations:
Equal (EQ): Checks if two values are equal.
Not Equal (NEQ): Checks if two values are not equal.
Greater Than (GT): Checks if one value is greater than another.
Less Than (LT): Checks if one value is less than another.
Greater Than or Equal (GE): Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.
Less Than or Equal (LE): Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.
5. Increment/Decrement:
Increment: Increases a value by one.
Decrement: Decreases a value by one.
6. Set/Reset Bit:
Set Bit: Sets a specific bit to 1.
Reset Bit: Resets a specific bit to 0.
7. Bitwise Operations:
Bitwise AND, OR, NOT, XOR: Perform bitwise operations on binary representations.
8. Conversion Operations:
Two's Complement: Finds the twoâ€™s complement of a binary number, useful for signed number representation.
BCD to Binary, Binary to BCD: Converts between Binary Coded Decimal and binary.
9. Overflow, Underflow, Zero Flag:
Overflow/Underflow Detection: Determines if an arithmetic operation resulted in a number too large/small to be represented.
Zero Flag: Indicates if the result of an operation is zero.
10. Conditional Operations:
Conditional Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide: Performs arithmetic operations based on certain conditions or flags.
11. Clamp Operations:
Min/Max Clamping: Restricts a value to a minimum/maximum limit.
12. Miscellaneous:
Count Leading/Trailing Zeros: Counts the number of leading/trailing zeros in a binary number.
13. Floating Point Operations:
Floating Point Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide: Performs arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers.
Floating Point Comparison: Compares floating-point numbers.
