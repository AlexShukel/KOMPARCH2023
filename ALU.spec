Functions to be implemented:

0000 = ADD
0001 = ADD with carry
0010 = SUB
0011 = SUB with borrow
0100 = NEG (2's complement)
0101 = INC (increment)
0110 = DEC (decrement)
0111 = PAS (pass argument A directly in Out)
1000 = AND
1001 = OR
1010 = XOR
1011 = INV (inverse all bits - 1's complement)
1100 = ASH (arithmetic shift)
1101 = LSH (logical shift)
1110 = RSH (rotate shift)
1111 = RSHC (rotate shift through carry)
